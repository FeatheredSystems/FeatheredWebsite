The security of the protocol relies entirely on password management. This password is essentially a secret key, so treat it as such and protect it properly. It must be a fixed-size array of 32 bytes, generated using a cryptographically secure method. The password is the main pillar of the protocol's safety â€” which is expected, as TLS (over HTTP) works similarly. The difference here is that the password is managed by you, the operator.
