Error handling varies depending on the request type, since each type is interpreted differently. For request type 0 (authentication/connection establishment), if the cipher text fails to decrypt, the server treats the client as foreign and unauthorized. In response, the server silently closes the connection without sending any message or notification. The server assumes that legitimate clients will always use the correct password.

For request type 1 (message sending), if the server fails to decrypt the payload, it interprets this as a transmission failure and returns an empty response (a u64 with the value 0, simulating a response of length 0).

For request type 2 (ping), no decryption is performed and no error handling is needed, since only the request type is relevant.

If an unregistered request type is received, the server ignores it without taking any action.

## Panics (Rust Implementation)
The protocol assumes you will not write faulty code that causes a panic. Ensure your implementation avoids conditions that could lead to a system panic.
