# Compatibility

The database is written in Rust and C, which means that it is portable across processors and systems. However, the program relies on io_uring, which means that the kernel must be version 5.1 or newer. If you are on an ARM device or want to compile the program yourself, the C part of the code (io.c) uses a global include #include, which must be available during compilation.
