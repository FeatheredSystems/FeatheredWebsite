# Alba Types
Referring to data types, Alba types is the name given to all the individual types a column can have in the database (Alba was the name of the query language the database once had in its first versions). The table below shows all the types available to be used within the program and their properties.

| AlbaType ID | Type Name      | Max Content Size        | Disk Size            | Description                                                  |

| 9           | MEDIUM-STRING  | up to 500 bytes         | 500 + 8 = 508 bytes  | Fixed-max medium string with length prefix                   |
| 10          | BIG-STRING     | up to 2,000 bytes       | 2,000 + 8 = 2,008 B  | Fixed-max large string with length prefix                    |
| 11          | LARGE-STRING   | up to 3,000 bytes       | 3,000 + 8 = 3,008 B  | Fixed-max very large string with length prefix               |
| 12          | NANO-BYTES     | up to 10 bytes          | 10 + 8 = 18 bytes    | Small fixed-max blob with length prefix                      |
| 13          | SMALL-BYTES    | up to 1,000 bytes       | 1,000 + 8 = 1,008 B  | Fixed-max small blob with length prefix                      |
| 14          | MEDIUM-BYTES   | up to 10,000 bytes      | 10,000 + 8 = 10,008 B| Fixed-max medium blob with length prefix                     |
| 15          | BIG-BYTES      | up to 100,000 bytes     | 100,000 + 8 = 100,008 B | Fixed-max large blob with length prefix                  |
| 16          | LARGE-BYTES    | up to 1,000,000 bytes   | 1,000,000 + 8 = 1,000,008 B | Fixed-max very large blob with length prefix         |

**Note:** The “+8” in the NANO, SMALL, MEDIUM, BIG, and LARGE data types comes from an unsigned 64-bit integer that stores the actual length of the data.
