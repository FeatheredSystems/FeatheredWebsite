# Getting started

To get started you must download the database using the command below

```curl -fsSL https://tytodb.pages.dev/installer.sh | bash```

To use it, you must write commands, queries, or transactions by using connection handlers like the TytoDB-Rust-Client. To configure the database or manage the program files manually, the files are usually in ~/TytoDB, since it uses $HOME/TytoDB to store its files.
