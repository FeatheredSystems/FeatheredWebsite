# Configurations
The configurations change the way the database does certain things. The configuration file is found in the database's directory ($HOME/TytoDB/), named settings.yaml, which contains several elements:

min_columns: The minimum count of columns every container must have on creation (will not affect existing containers).
max_columns: The maximum count of columns every container can have on creation (will not affect existing containers).
ip: The host the database will listen to.
port: The port on the host the database will be listening to.
vacuum: The schedule of the "Vacuum" function.
Vacuum Scheduling
This setting in the YAML file is a list where every element is a string tuple. The first item is the container name (where the vacuum will happen), and the second is when the vacuum must happen, which can follow 4 different patterns:

"X unit": Where X is a number and unit is a unit of time (available units: "seconds", "minutes", "hours", "years", or "decades"). When using this schedule pattern, the function will be run every X * unit. For example, if X is 10 and the unit is "years", then a vacuum will happen every 10 years.
"HH:MM:SS": Schedules a vacuum to happen every day at the specified hour. For example, if set to "01:00:00", the database will run a vacuum every day at 1 AM.
"MM/DD HH:MM:SS": Schedules a vacuum to happen every year at the specified month, day, and time of day. For example, if set to "01/01 01:00:00", the database will run a vacuum every year on January 1st at 1 AM.
"once": Does not schedule a vacuum to happen repeatedly but runs a vacuum once on database startup.
General Example:

vacuum:
- ["users", "once"]
- ["logs", "12:00:00"]
- ["data", "5 minutes"]
