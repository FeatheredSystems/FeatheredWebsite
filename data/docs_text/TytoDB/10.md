# Networking

The database is network-based and listens on a port on a host (configured in the configurations), using TCP to operate. It employs FalcoTCP to handle the low-level networking alongside the cryptography of data being transmitted and connections. When a client sends bytes to the server, it tries to interpret them, and that is how commands are submitted to TytoDB. To handle those "bytes" the database receives and interprets, a connection handler built on top of FalcoTCP must be used. That handler will use an API/UI (whichever method is chosen) to help generate the byte instructions.
